# Artifical Neural Network Library
Right now this is a super-simple library that can be used to create artifical neural networks for use in classification and prediction problems.  It's far from optimized, but I've already managed to put it to good use on a few sample problems, included the Iris dataset.

More updates and code samples to come.
